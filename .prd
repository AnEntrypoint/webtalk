## .prd: Fix TTS Worker Fetch URL Issue

### Root Cause Analysis
- Worker is inline blob created from string in tts-client.js:38-39
- Worker tries to fetch `/models/tts/mimi_encoder.onnx` at tts-worker.js:8-14
- Relative URLs in blob workers don't resolve correctly - fetch fails with "Failed to parse URL"
- Server.js correctly serves files from `./models/tts/` directory
- Issue: Worker doesn't have correct URL context to resolve `/models/tts/` paths

### Dependencies Graph
- Fix URL resolution in worker [blocks] Test worker loads models
- Test worker loads models [blocks] Verify TTS generates audio
- Verify TTS generates audio [blocks] Complete

### Independent Items (Wave 1) - COMPLETED
- [x] Identify all fetch paths in tts-worker.js that use relative URLs
- [x] Determine correct absolute URL construction (needs window location or injected base URL)
- [x] Modify tts-client.js getWorkerScript() to inject BASE_URL into worker
- [x] Update MODELS object in worker script to use absolute URLs
- [x] Verify absolute URLs are properly formed (http://localhost:8080/models/tts/...)
- [x] Test that all URLs are valid and parseable

### Sequential Items (Remaining)
- [ ] Commit the changes
- [ ] Start server with npm start
- [ ] Open browser to http://localhost:8080
- [ ] Trigger TTS initialization and verify no "Failed to parse URL" errors
- [ ] Verify worker successfully loads model files
- [ ] Verify audio generation works end-to-end

### Edge Cases & Validation
- Verify works with different PORT environment variables
- Verify works with http://localhost:PORT and http://127.0.0.1:PORT
- Verify works in browser console worker context
- Verify CORS not blocking model fetches
- Verify file paths resolve correctly on Windows path separator
- Verify worker doesn't hang on failed fetches
- Verify error messages are descriptive

### Acceptance Criteria
- ✓ Worker successfully fetches mimi_encoder.onnx
- ✓ All 5 ONNX model files load without fetch errors
- ✓ Tokenizer.model and voices.bin load successfully
- ✓ TTS generates audio chunks
- ✓ No "Failed to parse URL" errors in console
- ✓ Real audio output in browser
- ✓ System stable with proper error handling if model load fails
