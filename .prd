   - Inject window.location.origin as BASE_URL into worker script
   - Convert all model paths from relative to absolute URLs

2. **194e9d4**: Add graceful fallback for missing voices.bin file
   - Wrap voice loading in try/catch block
   - Provide default voice embedding if voices.bin fetch fails

✓ Voices.bin missing is handled gracefully with fallback
✓ No relative path URLs remain in worker code
